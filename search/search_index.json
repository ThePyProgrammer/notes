Enthalpy, \\(\\Delta H\\) Essentially change in heat of system caused by any particular reaction taking place within said system. It is a state function , which means every path to get from one set of reactants to one set of products requires the same enthalpy change. This also means that the reverse reaction has the opposite polarity and same magnitude of enthalpy change. This is known as Hess's Law . Standard State Enthalpy, \\(\\Delta H ^{\\circ}\\) Enthalpy change is not the same at every point. Different variables like temperature, pressure and concentration and more can influence the enthalpy change. Standard State is defined to be the following: State Condition for Standard State Enthalpy Liquid, Solid Pure Gaseous 1 atm Aqueous 1 M Computing \\(\\Delta H\\) experimentally In most reactions, we often conduct it in water, or on a surface not participating in the reaction (or both, like in a Calorimeter). In this case, we must know the following values: Specific Heat Capacity of the Solution : \\(c\\) Mass of the Solution : \\(m\\) Heat Capacity of Surface: \\(C\\) Change in Temperature: \\(\\Delta T\\) From here, we can compute the energy absorbed/supplied by the surroundings via the formula \\(q = mc\\Delta T + C\\Delta T\\) . This is the energy released for the given moles of reactants, so we need to divide it by said number of moles reacted to get the actual Enthalpy Change. Thus: \\[\\Delta H = -\\frac{mc\\Delta T + C\\Delta T}{n_\\text{limit}}\\] Enthalpy of Formation, \\(\\Delta H_f\\) Formation Enthalpy is the enthalpy of the reaction that forms the compound from its constituent elements. Note that these elements should be in their most stable allotropic state, which essentially means the state they are most likely to be found in. For a compound \\(\\text{ABC}\\) , where \\(\\text{A}\\) exists in the form of gaseous \\(\\text{A}_2\\) for stability, \\(\\text{B}\\) remains in solid state and \\(C\\) is Carbon, we have the following expression: \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ A}_2\\text{ (g) } + \\text{ B (s) } + \\text{ C (graphite)} \\rightarrow \\text{ABC}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_f\\] For elements in their most stable allotropic state, their \\(\\Delta H_f\\) is 0. This is why the Formation Enthalpies of Graphite and Oxygen gas are 0, while those of Diamond or Ozone are not. Using \\(\\Delta H_f\\) meaningfully An extension of this is seen when we are required to compute the enthalpy change of any given reaction. Since we can simplify all reactants to the their allotropic elements via the reverse reaction, and produce the products from said allotropes, we can essentially represent the the reaction enthalpy as follows: \\[\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum n_\\text{product} \\Delta H_{f, \\text{ product}} - \\sum n_\\text{ reactant} \\Delta H_{f, \\text{reactant}}\\] This makes it easier for us to retrieve the enthalpy change of a reaction. Enthalpy of Combustion, \\(\\Delta H_c\\) Combustion is ALWAYS an exothermic reaction, so this enthalpy is always negative. The general reaction is as follows: \\[\\text{C}_x\\text{H}_y\\text{O}_z+\\frac{4x+y-2z}{4}\\text{ O}_2\\text{ (g) } \\rightarrow x \\text{ CO}_2 + \\frac{y}{2}\\text{ H}_2\\text{O}\\quad\\Delta H_c\\] Enthalpy of Neutralisation, \\(\\Delta H_n\\) This is the enthalpy change of any given neutralisation reaction to form one mole of water. \\[\\text{H}^+\\text{ (aq)}+\\text{OH}^-\\text{ (aq)}\\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O (l)} \\quad\\quad\\Delta H_n\\] Note: The above reaction is simply the ionic reaction, this is actually still the enthalpy change of the actual reaction. Enthalpy of Atomization, \\(\\Delta H_a\\) Atomization has two cases, as follows: \\(\\Delta H_a\\) for uni-elemental molecules This pertain to the atomization enthalpy of any given molecule, and the reaction is such that one mole of the elemental gas is formed: \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\text{ X}_n \\rightarrow \\text{X (g)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_a\\] \\(\\Delta H_a\\) for multi-elemental molecules If any given molecule is made of more that a single elemnt, the reaction is such that one mole of the molecule is formed. \\[\\text{X}_m\\text{Y}_n \\rightarrow m\\text{ X (g) }+n\\text{ Y (g)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_a\\] Using \\(\\Delta H_a\\) meaningfully Same thing as with \\(\\Delta H_f\\) . \\[\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum n_\\text{reactant} \\Delta H_{a, \\text{ reactant}} - \\sum n_\\text{product} \\Delta H_{a, \\text{ product}}\\] Bond Energy, \\(BE\\) This is technically a side-tour. Bond Energy is the energy required to overcome a bond (i.e it is endothermic, positive). The reaction for an example is as follows: \\[\\text{Cl}-\\text{Cl} \\rightarrow 2\\text{ Cl}\\quad \\quad BE_{\\text{Cl}-\\text{Cl}}\\] This is similar to the formation enthalpy (of course it's the reverse reaction), and it's only for one bond. But we can also use this meaningfully! Using \\(BE\\) meaningfully Same thing as with \\(\\Delta H_a\\) honestly. \\[\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum BE_\\text{bonds broken} - \\sum BE_\\text{bonds formed}\\] Lattice Energy, \\(\\Delta H_\\text{LE}\\) This is the energy required to dissociate a solid ionic lattice into gaseous ions, for instance as follows: \\[\\text{X}_m\\text{Y}_n\\text{ (s)}\\rightarrow m\\text{ X}^{n+}\\text{ (g) }+n\\text{ Y}^{m-}\\text{ (g) }\\quad \\Delta H_{LE}\\] This is proportional to the charges and inversely proportional to the ionic radii. Ionization Energy, \\(\\Delta H_{n\\text{th IE}}\\) Basically the energy required for a gaseous atom/ ion to release an electron. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{X (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^+\\text{ (g) }+ e^- \\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{1st IE} \\\\ \\text{X}^+\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{2+}\\text{ (g) }+ e^- \\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{2nd IE} \\\\ \\text{X}^{2+}\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{3+}\\text{ (g) }+ e^- \\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{3rd IE} \\end{align*} \\] Electron Affinity, \\(\\Delta H_{n\\text{th EA}}\\) Basically the energy required for a gaseous atom/ ion to absorb an electron. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{X (g) }+e^-&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^-\\text{ (g)}\\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{1st EA} \\\\ \\text{X}^-\\text{ (g) }+e^-&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{2-}\\text{ (g)}\\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{2nd EA} \\\\ \\text{X}^{2-}\\text{ (g) }+e^-&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{3-}\\text{ (g)}\\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{3rd EA} \\end{align*} \\] Enthalpy of Hydration, \\(\\Delta H_{hyd}\\) This is an always exothermic reaction to dissolve gaseous ions into water. It is proportional to the charge density ( \\(|Q|/r\\) ). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{X}^{m+}\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{ X}^{m+}\\text{ (aq)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_{hyd, \\text{ cation}}\\\\ \\text{Y}^{n-}\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{ Y}^{n-}\\text{ (aq)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_{hyd, \\text{ anion}} \\end{align*} \\] Enthalpy of Solution, \\(\\Delta H_\\text{solution}\\) This is the enthalpy change to dissolve any ionic lattice into water.

It\u2019s not just imagining, it\u2019s living. \" ~ Finch (2021 Movie) Ethics Huge pressure placed on Scientists by Research Institutes Securing a permanent role in Bell Labs in the early 2000s was impossible Getting tenure at universities is also incredibly competitive Strain on their mental health, well-being Many Scientists fabricate data in order to get past their due dates Jan Hendrik Schon's faked graphs of data by removing noise entirely and presenting best fitting curves/lines, with nearly 300 papers published in the span of 3 years at Bell Labs Disgruntled Stem-Cell Biologist Dr Yoshiki Sasai's high-profile suicide after the revelation that she allegedly fabricated data in papers published in international journals Reproducibility of results in often absent Reproducibility Project worked closely with the original authors of 53 seminal cancer studies, and only manged to replicate the results of 6. 80% of published research is worthless at the current juncture Many AI-related research works focus on making small changes to accuracy values (\" delta papers \") Single Blind Peer Review Processes adopted - papers often published based on name and recognition rather than actual credit Process Single Blind Double Blind How Authors are unaware of who the Reviewers are, but the Reviewers know who the Authors are Authors and Reviewers are both unaware of who the other is Why is DB Better? The name of the authors is a considerable factor in the peer review process. Anonymity ensures that quality of paper is assessed rather than the name of the authors Examples Peter Higgs, whose seminal paper postulating the existence of the Higgs Boson, was rejected by the Physics Letters Journal, one infamous for employing single blind protocol in peer review processes, although later it was proven to be true and Higgs even won a Nobel Prize for his work back in 2013. NYU Professor Yann LeCun, who is internationally regarded as one of the pioneers of modern AI development, recently posted on many Social Media sites with the proud admission that one of his most recent papers was rejected by the NeurIPS journal, one graded on double blind protocol. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Generative AI GPT-3 was introduced in 2021, went on public access in July 2022 Simplified a lot of Natural Language-related tasks Singapore-based start-up Hypotenuse.AI uses such models to generate descriptive marketing content, very much indistinguishable from human content creators (Marketing Staff) Was able to write up full-fledged applications (Software Developers) DALL-E 2.0 and Imagen in 2022, \"Stable Diffusion\" as a concept was popularized in 2022 Midjourney won the Colorado State Fair annual art competition Many worried regarding their job prospects AI Art has existed for a while, but new technologies allow one without skill/ training to produce award-winning art Major Questions Who owns the rights to the output? The Software Developers / Tech Companies who trained these models? The Hundreds of Millions of artists who supplied data for the model? The individual who simply put a text query through the model? Does this endanger the jobs of artists and content creators? How about the smaller budget start-ups / enterprises that can't afford the prices of such content creators? Interpretability of AI Products AI is a \" black-box \" - underneath workings are unknown How can we trust the AI models? AI and Automation AI is adopted in numerous factories Higher precision, higher accuracy (no real trade-offs) 400k jobs lost to automation in US factories (1997 - 2007) 40M jobs shed during the pandemic, 42% of these jobs are gone forever A paper by MIT and Boston Uni Economists found that robots can replace nearly 2 million more workers in manufacturing by 2025 Targetting Blue Collar Worker jobs Higher Social Stratification between the two income groups Most Blue Collar Workers are from marginalized races (e.g. African American, Latino/Latinx), more racial segregation Big Tech Definitions Big Tech / FAGMA : Word/Acronym used to describe the five largest tech companies in the world, namely Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple Sometimes includes Tesla and Nvidia (FAANG) Apple was the first of these to achieve a two trillion dollar valuation in August 2020 The combined net worth of these five, in addition to five other top tech companies, rounds up to a whopping nine trillion dollars. BATX : Acronym used to describe China's four largest tech companies, that being Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi. ByteDance is often counted into this list, despite it's name being missing from the actual acronym Beijing has, over the past two years, started to crack down on these companies, especially Alibaba. General Scandals The NSA Scandal : It was revealed in 2013 that America's NSA and their British counterpart had been stealing information secretively from users of Google, Yahoo and many other tech products, with the creators of the products being completely oblivious to this happening. This led to widespread fear regarding government surveillance and stigmated views against Big Tech. Classified as \"surveillance\", since the data was used as a form of targeted monitoring to triangulate individuals based on the others' relative positions in order to identify potential threats. The Capitol Riots and Trump's Ban : After the absolutely horrific events of January 6th 2021, where a mob of individuals barreled their way into the US Capitol Building in support of Trump after his recent loss in the presidential elections, Trump was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. YouTube also banned him, and Apple and Google both refused to offer the Parler, which was commonly associated with Trump and his followers, on their respective mobile app stores. This was followed officially with the impeachment of Trump just a few short days of his term, but it also painted a picture of just how powerful Big Tech Countries, with their act of censorship making them act more like a government than a group of businesses. Meta-Focused Scandals The Cambridge Analytica Scandal : In 2016, after Trump's victory at the Election, it was revealed that the company it was working with, Cambridge Analytica, had been surreptitiously stealing data from Facebook users and in an effort to manipulate and brainwash them, by showing people against Trump's campaign more positive articles about his work to influence their decision to work. This massive scandal led to widespread stigma against Big Tech and especially Facebook, which had yet to come into the line of fire. However, Facebook was the most severely hit, with the years that followed being some of its worst. The Rohingya Genocide and Facebook's Involvement : The Rohingya Genocide happened as a result of the overly stigmatized views of people against the Rohingya Muslims, a set of muslims often considered some of the, if not the most discriminated people in the world. During the genocide, many of the military officers went on Facebook posing as popular individuals and purposely incited hate speech, which was one of the main catalysts for the truly inhumane acts that followed. The Christchurch Shootings : In March 2019, a man openly streamed his video on Facebook Live as he went and shot nearly 51 people in 2 mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in an effort to spread hate speech towards the Muslim population in New Zealand. The videos surfaced on Facebook, with many audience members surprisingly cheering on for the act to continue, leaving a bleak shot of the white nationalism ever present in Oceania today. While this may not be fully attributed to Facebook, it was nonetheless a display of one of Facebook's weakest moments. The Facebook Whistleblower, Frances Haughen : An ex-employee of Facebook, Frances Haughen had been secretly copying and storing hundreds of internal files in Facebook with regards to research it had done on the impacts of its algorithms to better serve their purpose as a tech company, and shared it with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), leading to the creation of the \"Facebook Files\" series at the WSJ. Research done by Facebook itself found that angrier posts often got higher engagements , hence in 2018, Facebook's algorithms were reconfigured to give priority to these posts in user feeds. An implication of this would entail that more individuals would be angrier while reading the post and it is definitely possible that it may have led to incitement of more hate speech. This is incredibly problematic, but Facebook's insistence to focus on the profit made by more user retention due to this algorithm led to this being left to the wayside by the developers. During the sudden appearance of the pandemic, a large number of posts with contradictory information was shared on these social media platforms that left many users excessively confused. In fact, a study by the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) revealed that 6 in 10 Singaporeans received fake information regarding the pandemic. This information overload, or \" infodemic \", as termed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), has led to the spread of excessive amounts of misinformation. During events like the excessive aftermath of George Floyd's death and the Taliban's take-over of Afghanistan, an incredible number of posts led to these events being blown out of proportion. WhatsApp's Privacy Settings : In the beginning of 2021, millions of people around the globe received a message on their phones that WhatsApp was updating their privacy settings such that certain data would be stored by WhatsApp. Being an application recently acquired by Facebook, this message led to immediate terror and uproar amongst the general populace, with many worldwide immediately deleting the app and switching to Telegram and Signal, the latter of which was instigated by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While these concerns ended up being overexaggerated, it was still notable that the general populace has become more receptive to privacy concerns and the impacts that these settings could have. General 4IR Stuff A 2017 study by the European Patent Office found the number of patents filed related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution increased a growth rate of 54 percent in the past three years.
