Enthalpy, \\(\\Delta H\\) Essentially change in heat of system caused by any particular reaction taking place within said system. It is a state function , which means every path to get from one set of reactants to one set of products requires the same enthalpy change. This also means that the reverse reaction has the opposite polarity and same magnitude of enthalpy change. This is known as Hess's Law . Standard State Enthalpy, \\(\\Delta H ^{\\circ}\\) Enthalpy change is not the same at every point. Different variables like temperature, pressure and concentration and more can influence the enthalpy change. Standard State is defined to be the following: State Condition for Standard State Enthalpy Liquid, Solid Pure Gaseous 1 atm Aqueous 1 M Computing \\(\\Delta H\\) experimentally In most reactions, we often conduct it in water, or on a surface not participating in the reaction (or both, like in a Calorimeter). In this case, we must know the following values: Specific Heat Capacity of the Solution : \\(c\\) Mass of the Solution : \\(m\\) Heat Capacity of Surface: \\(C\\) Change in Temperature: \\(\\Delta T\\) From here, we can compute the energy absorbed/supplied by the surroundings via the formula \\(q = mc\\Delta T + C\\Delta T\\) . This is the energy released for the given moles of reactants, so we need to divide it by said number of moles reacted to get the actual Enthalpy Change. Thus: \\[\\Delta H = -\\frac{mc\\Delta T + C\\Delta T}{n_\\text{limit}}\\] Enthalpy of Formation, \\(\\Delta H_f\\) Formation Enthalpy is the enthalpy of the reaction that forms the compound from its constituent elements. Note that these elements should be in their most stable allotropic state, which essentially means the state they are most likely to be found in. For a compound \\(\\text{ABC}\\) , where \\(\\text{A}\\) exists in the form of gaseous \\(\\text{A}_2\\) for stability, \\(\\text{B}\\) remains in solid state and \\(C\\) is Carbon, we have the following expression: \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ A}_2\\text{ (g) } + \\text{ B (s) } + \\text{ C (graphite)} \\rightarrow \\text{ABC}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_f\\] For elements in their most stable allotropic state, their \\(\\Delta H_f\\) is 0. This is why the Formation Enthalpies of Graphite and Oxygen gas are 0, while those of Diamond or Ozone are not. Using \\(\\Delta H_f\\) meaningfully An extension of this is seen when we are required to compute the enthalpy change of any given reaction. Since we can simplify all reactants to the their allotropic elements via the reverse reaction, and produce the products from said allotropes, we can essentially represent the the reaction enthalpy as follows: \\[\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum n_\\text{product} \\Delta H_{f, \\text{ product}} - \\sum n_\\text{ reactant} \\Delta H_{f, \\text{reactant}}\\] This makes it easier for us to retrieve the enthalpy change of a reaction. Enthalpy of Combustion, \\(\\Delta H_c\\) Combustion is ALWAYS an exothermic reaction, so this enthalpy is always negative. The general reaction is as follows: \\[\\text{C}_x\\text{H}_y\\text{O}_z+\\frac{4x+y-2z}{4}\\text{ O}_2\\text{ (g) } \\rightarrow x \\text{ CO}_2 + \\frac{y}{2}\\text{ H}_2\\text{O}\\quad\\Delta H_c\\] Enthalpy of Neutralisation, \\(\\Delta H_n\\) This is the enthalpy change of any given neutralisation reaction to form one mole of water. \\[\\text{H}^+\\text{ (aq)}+\\text{OH}^-\\text{ (aq)}\\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O (l)} \\quad\\quad\\Delta H_n\\] Note: The above reaction is simply the ionic reaction, this is actually still the enthalpy change of the actual reaction. Enthalpy of Atomization, \\(\\Delta H_a\\) Atomization has two cases, as follows: \\(\\Delta H_a\\) for uni-elemental molecules This pertain to the atomization enthalpy of any given molecule, and the reaction is such that one mole of the elemental gas is formed: \\[\\frac{1}{n}\\text{ X}_n \\rightarrow \\text{X (g)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_a\\] \\(\\Delta H_a\\) for multi-elemental molecules If any given molecule is made of more that a single elemnt, the reaction is such that one mole of the molecule is formed. \\[\\text{X}_m\\text{Y}_n \\rightarrow m\\text{ X (g) }+n\\text{ Y (g)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_a\\] Using \\(\\Delta H_a\\) meaningfully Same thing as with \\(\\Delta H_f\\) . \\[\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum n_\\text{reactant} \\Delta H_{a, \\text{ reactant}} - \\sum n_\\text{product} \\Delta H_{a, \\text{ product}}\\] Bond Energy, \\(BE\\) This is technically a side-tour. Bond Energy is the energy required to overcome a bond (i.e it is endothermic, positive). The reaction for an example is as follows: \\[\\text{Cl}-\\text{Cl} \\rightarrow 2\\text{ Cl}\\quad \\quad BE_{\\text{Cl}-\\text{Cl}}\\] This is similar to the formation enthalpy (of course it's the reverse reaction), and it's only for one bond. But we can also use this meaningfully! Using \\(BE\\) meaningfully Same thing as with \\(\\Delta H_a\\) honestly. \\[\\Delta H_{rxn} = \\sum BE_\\text{bonds broken} - \\sum BE_\\text{bonds formed}\\] Lattice Energy, \\(\\Delta H_\\text{LE}\\) This is the energy required to dissociate a solid ionic lattice into gaseous ions, for instance as follows: \\[\\text{X}_m\\text{Y}_n\\text{ (s)}\\rightarrow m\\text{ X}^{n+}\\text{ (g) }+n\\text{ Y}^{m-}\\text{ (g) }\\quad \\Delta H_{LE}\\] This is proportional to the charges and inversely proportional to the ionic radii. Ionization Energy, \\(\\Delta H_{n\\text{th IE}}\\) Basically the energy required for a gaseous atom/ ion to release an electron. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{X (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^+\\text{ (g) }+ e^- \\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{1st IE} \\\\ \\text{X}^+\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{2+}\\text{ (g) }+ e^- \\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{2nd IE} \\\\ \\text{X}^{2+}\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{3+}\\text{ (g) }+ e^- \\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{3rd IE} \\end{align*} \\] Electron Affinity, \\(\\Delta H_{n\\text{th EA}}\\) Basically the energy required for a gaseous atom/ ion to absorb an electron. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{X (g) }+e^-&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^-\\text{ (g)}\\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{1st EA} \\\\ \\text{X}^-\\text{ (g) }+e^-&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{2-}\\text{ (g)}\\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{2nd EA} \\\\ \\text{X}^{2-}\\text{ (g) }+e^-&\\rightarrow\\text{X}^{3-}\\text{ (g)}\\quad\\quad \\Delta H_\\text{3rd EA} \\end{align*} \\] Enthalpy of Hydration, \\(\\Delta H_{hyd}\\) This is an always exothermic reaction to dissolve gaseous ions into water. It is proportional to the charge density ( \\(|Q|/r\\) ). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{X}^{m+}\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{ X}^{m+}\\text{ (aq)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_{hyd, \\text{ cation}}\\\\ \\text{Y}^{n-}\\text{ (g) }&\\rightarrow\\text{ Y}^{n-}\\text{ (aq)}\\quad\\quad\\Delta H_{hyd, \\text{ anion}} \\end{align*} \\] Enthalpy of Solution, \\(\\Delta H_\\text{solution}\\) This is the enthalpy change to dissolve any ionic lattice into water.

BATX : Acronym used to describe China's four largest tech companies, that being Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi. ByteDance is often counted into this list, despite it's name being missing from the actual acronym Beijing has, over the past two years, started to crack down on these companies, especially Alibaba. General Scandals The NSA Scandal : It was revealed in 2013 that America's NSA and their British counterpart had been stealing information secretively from users of Google, Yahoo and many other tech products, with the creators of the products being completely oblivious to this happening. This led to widespread fear regarding government surveillance and stigmated views against Big Tech. Classified as \"surveillance\", since the data was used as a form of targeted monitoring to triangulate individuals based on the others' relative positions in order to identify potential threats. The Capitol Riots and Trump's Ban : After the absolutely horrific events of January 6th 2021, where a mob of individuals barreled their way into the US Capitol Building in support of Trump after his recent loss in the presidential elections, Trump was permanently banned from multiple social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. YouTube also banned him, and Apple and Google both refused to offer the Parler, which was commonly associated with Trump and his followers, on their respective mobile app stores. This was followed officially with the impeachment of Trump just a few short days of his term, but it also painted a picture of just how powerful Big Tech Countries, with their act of censorship making them act more like a government than a group of businesses. Meta-Focused Scandals The Cambridge Analytica Scandal : In 2016, after Trump's victory at the Election, it was revealed that the company it was working with, Cambridge Analytica, had been surreptitiously stealing data from Facebook users and in an effort to manipulate and brainwash them, by showing people against Trump's campaign more positive articles about his work to influence their decision to work. This massive scandal led to widespread stigma against Big Tech and especially Facebook, which had yet to come into the line of fire. However, Facebook was the most severely hit, with the years that followed being some of its worst. The Rohingya Genocide and Facebook's Involvement : The Rohingya Genocide happened as a result of the overly stigmatized views of people against the Rohingya Muslims, a set of muslims often considered some of the, if not the most discriminated people in the world. During the genocide, many of the military officers went on Facebook posing as popular individuals and purposely incited hate speech, which was one of the main catalysts for the truly inhumane acts that followed. The Christchurch Shootings : In March 2019, a man openly streamed his video on Facebook Live as he went and shot nearly 51 people in 2 mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in an effort to spread hate speech towards the Muslim population in New Zealand. The videos surfaced on Facebook, with many audience members surprisingly cheering on for the act to continue, leaving a bleak shot of the white nationalism ever present in Oceania today. While this may not be fully attributed to Facebook, it was nonetheless a display of one of Facebook's weakest moments. The Facebook Whistleblower, Frances Haughen : An ex-employee of Facebook, Frances Haughen had been secretly copying and storing hundreds of internal files in Facebook with regards to research it had done on the impacts of its algorithms to better serve their purpose as a tech company, and shared it with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), leading to the creation of the \"Facebook Files\" series at the WSJ. Research done by Facebook itself found that angrier posts often got higher engagements , hence in 2018, Facebook's algorithms were reconfigured to give priority to these posts in user feeds. An implication of this would entail that more individuals would be angrier while reading the post and it is definitely possible that it may have led to incitement of more hate speech. This is incredibly problematic, but Facebook's insistence to focus on the profit made by more user retention due to this algorithm led to this being left to the wayside by the developers. During the sudden appearance of the pandemic, a large number of posts with contradictory information was shared on these social media platforms that left many users excessively confused. In fact, a study by the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) revealed that 6 in 10 Singaporeans received fake information regarding the pandemic. This information overload, or \" infodemic \", as termed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), has led to the spread of excessive amounts of misinformation. During events like the excessive aftermath of George Floyd's death and the Taliban's take-over of Afghanistan, an incredible number of posts led to these events being blown out of proportion. WhatsApp's Privacy Settings : In the beginning of 2021, millions of people around the globe received a message on their phones that WhatsApp was updating their privacy settings such that certain data would be stored by WhatsApp. Being an application recently acquired by Facebook, this message led to immediate terror and uproar amongst the general populace, with many worldwide immediately deleting the app and switching to Telegram and Signal, the latter of which was instigated by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While these concerns ended up being overexaggerated, it was still notable that the general populace has become more receptive to privacy concerns and the impacts that these settings could have.

In its summary for policy-makers, the report\u2019s authors outlined a series of near-term, mid-term, and long-term risks. If global warming reaches 1.5\u00b0C in the near term (2021-2040), it would cause \u201cunavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards,\u201d as well as \u201cmultiple risks to ecosystems and humans.\u201d In the long term, climate change will present major health issues, premature deaths, risks to cities and settlements, and other dangers. Mitigation is desperately needed \u2013 and fast. Because of climate change\u2019s connection to other issues on this list, it\u2019s one of the most serious challenges facing humanity. COVID-19 The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2022. It will continue to be a major issue for the world. The WEF\u2019s Global Risks Report 2022 discusses COVID\u2019s effects at length, including major economic recovery disparities and social erosion. According to a January 2022 article from NPR, there are also issues with vaccinations as many countries continue to have trouble getting doses. Distribution, vaccine hesitancy, healthcare systems, and other problems also factor into low vaccination rates. While we may never know the exact impact, the WHO estimates that between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, there were around 14.9 million excess deaths linked to COVID-19. Future pandemic preparation and response COVID-19 taught the world the importance of prepardeness. In a Harvard blog, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, outlined the lessons the world should take to heart. The first: science has to guide policy. The politicization of the pandemic led to a lot of unnecessary damage. Another lesson is that science must pair with equity or it can actually make inequalities worse. This is obvious when looking at how low-income countries struggled to get the vaccines while wealthier countries stocked up. More resilient healthcare systems are also a must, as well as more coherent, global plans on how to respond. The world must also invest in research on contagious diseases, zoonotic diseases, the effectiveness of outbreak responses, and more. Disability rights According to the WHO, over 1 billion people have some form of disability. Half can\u2019t afford healthcare. They\u2019re also more likely to live in poverty than those without a disability, have poorer health outcomes, and have less access to work and education opportunities. Human Rights Watch lists other discriminations disabled people face, such as an increased risk of violence. There\u2019s been progress regarding disability rights, but many countries lack strong protections. The world still has a long way to go to ensure equality for those with disabilities. LGBTQ+ rights Members of the LGBTQ+ community face discrimination in many forms. According to Amnesty International, discrimination can target sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics. Even in more progressive countries like the United States, people face violence and discrimination. According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were proposed in 2022. At least a dozen states are considering legislation that forbids schools from discussing or using a curriculum that covers sexual orientation and gender identity. Considering the United States\u2019 influence in the world, this attack on LGBTQ+ rights will likely have consequences that need to be addressed. Reproductive justice Reproductive justice \u2013 which encompasses more than just abortion rights \u2013 is threatened by legislation, lack of funding, lack of education, and restricted healthcare access. In most places, wealth is a big determinant of whether a person can access reproductive services. It\u2019s better in some places than others, but as we\u2019ve seen with other issues on this list, even \u201cprogressive\u201d countries like the United States are experiencing major shifts. In June 2022, the Supreme Court is expected to overrule Roe v. Wade, a milestone court case that protected a pregnant woman\u2019s right to abortion. The impact would be immediate and will likely influence other countries. Gender equality Global gender equality has gradually improved over the years, but data from the 2021 Global Gender Report shows that the end of the global gender gap is still 135 years away. The pandemic played a huge role in reversing positive trends as women were hit harder financially. According to Oxfam, women experienced a 5% job loss while men experienced 3.9%. That means women lost about $800 million in 2020. This is a low estimate since it doesn\u2019t count the informal economy, which includes millions of women. Women are also more likely to live in poverty, more affected by gender-based violence, and more affected by climate change. Freedom of the press According to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (as reported in The Economist), about 85% of people live in a country where press freedom has gone down in the past 5 years. After peaking at .65 in the early 2000s and 2011, the global average dropped to .49 in 2021. Major countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, and Turkey saw significant declines. Journalists and news organizations face threats like violence, imprisonment, lack of funding, and coordinated online attacks and harassment. A free press is essential to a functioning democracy. Without press freedom, all human rights are at risk. Authoritarianism According to Freedom House, global democracy is eroding. That includes countries with long-established democracies. In their 2022 report, the organization reveals that global freedom has been declining for the past 16 years. 60 countries faced declines in the last year. Only 25 saw improvements. Only 20% of the global population lives in Free countries. China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries have gained more power in the international system, while countries with established democracies \u2013 like the United States \u2013 are losing their freedoms.

This is effectively segregation. Many of these SAP schools are considered elite schools and hence it also gatekeeps higher quality education for minorities. LGBTQ rights Article 377A a. s377A was introduced under colonial rule and criminalizes sex between males. while rarely enforced it has been the subject of criticism by many members and advocates of the LGBTQ community. Over the past few years, there have been numerous debates on whether it should be repealed as societal views shift to be more accepting of LGBTQ folk. The main opposition to the repeal has been religious groups which view homosexuality as a sin. However, this is not only a concern of religious people. Many non-religious people are fearful of homosexuality and view it as a threat to the family and current social norms. To appeal to both sides, the government agreed to repeal s377A, but it is strengthening the legal protection for the definition of traditional marriage making it harder for gay marriage to be legalized. I believe that the repeal of s377A is a step in the right direction when it comes to creating a more equitable society for LGBTQ folk.","title":"Social Issues"},{"location":"EL5131/social_issues_list/#existing-social-issues","text":"","title":"Existing Social issues"},{"location":"EL5131/social_issues_list/#global","text":"","title":"Global"},{"location":"EL5131/social_issues_list/#climate-change","text":"The IPCC released its sixth report in 2022.

The politicization of the pandemic led to a lot of unnecessary damage. Another lesson is that science must pair with equity or it can actually make inequalities worse. This is obvious when looking at how low-income countries struggled to get the vaccines while wealthier countries stocked up. More resilient healthcare systems are also a must, as well as more coherent, global plans on how to respond.

Chapter 2 of PC5131 is Waves... I. This is effectively singular waves, rather than interfering waves. This includes normal wave properties and equations, wave intensity, string waves, polarisation, sound waves (longitudinal waves) and the Doppler Effect. This is relatively easier than the next topic (Waves II) so uh yay thank god only this much is tested in the Common Test on Monday. Anyways yeah good luck, and let's see what comes out of this, right? Aight.
