# Existing Social issues

## Global

### Climate change
The IPCC released its sixth report in 2022. In its summary for policy-makers, the report’s authors outlined a series of near-term, mid-term, and long-term risks. If global warming reaches 1.5°C in the near term (2021-2040), it would cause “unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards,” as well as “multiple risks to ecosystems and humans.” In the long term, climate change will present major health issues, premature deaths, risks to cities and settlements, and other dangers. Mitigation is desperately needed – and fast. Because of climate change’s connection to other issues on this list, it’s one of the most serious challenges facing humanity.

### COVID-19
The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2022. It will continue to be a major issue for the world. The WEF’s Global Risks Report 2022 discusses COVID’s effects at length, including major economic recovery disparities and social erosion. According to a January 2022 article from NPR, there are also issues with vaccinations as many countries continue to have trouble getting doses. Distribution, vaccine hesitancy, healthcare systems, and other problems also factor into low vaccination rates. While we may never know the exact impact, the WHO estimates that between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, there were around 14.9 million excess deaths linked to COVID-19.

### Future pandemic preparation and response
COVID-19 taught the world the importance of prepardeness. In a Harvard blog, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, outlined the lessons the world should take to heart. The first: science has to guide policy. The politicization of the pandemic led to a lot of unnecessary damage. Another lesson is that science must pair with equity or it can actually make inequalities worse. This is obvious when looking at how low-income countries struggled to get the vaccines while wealthier countries stocked up. More resilient healthcare systems are also a must, as well as more coherent, global plans on how to respond. The world must also invest in research on contagious diseases, zoonotic diseases, the effectiveness of outbreak responses, and more.

### Disability rights
According to the WHO, over 1 billion people have some form of disability. Half can’t afford healthcare. They’re also more likely to live in poverty than those without a disability, have poorer health outcomes, and have less access to work and education opportunities. Human Rights Watch lists other discriminations disabled people face, such as an increased risk of violence. There’s been progress regarding disability rights, but many countries lack strong protections. The world still has a long way to go to ensure equality for those with disabilities.

### LGBTQ+ rights
Members of the LGBTQ+ community face discrimination in many forms. According to Amnesty International, discrimination can target sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics. Even in more progressive countries like the United States, people face violence and discrimination. According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were proposed in 2022. At least a dozen states are considering legislation that forbids schools from discussing or using a curriculum that covers sexual orientation and gender identity. Considering the United States’ influence in the world, this attack on LGBTQ+ rights will likely have consequences that need to be addressed.

### Reproductive justice
Reproductive justice – which encompasses more than just abortion rights – is threatened by legislation, lack of funding, lack of education, and restricted healthcare access. In most places, wealth is a big determinant of whether a person can access reproductive services. It’s better in some places than others, but as we’ve seen with other issues on this list, even “progressive” countries like the United States are experiencing major shifts. In June 2022, the Supreme Court is expected to overrule Roe v. Wade, a milestone court case that protected a pregnant woman’s right to abortion. The impact would be immediate and will likely influence other countries.


### Gender equality
Global gender equality has gradually improved over the years, but data from the 2021 Global Gender Report shows that the end of the global gender gap is still 135 years away. The pandemic played a huge role in reversing positive trends as women were hit harder financially. According to Oxfam, women experienced a 5% job loss while men experienced 3.9%. That means women lost about $800 million in 2020. This is a low estimate since it doesn’t count the informal economy, which includes millions of women. Women are also more likely to live in poverty, more affected by gender-based violence, and more affected by climate change.

### Freedom of the press
According to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (as reported in The Economist), about 85% of people live in a country where press freedom has gone down in the past 5 years. After peaking at .65 in the early 2000s and 2011, the global average dropped to .49 in 2021. Major countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, and Turkey saw significant declines. Journalists and news organizations face threats like violence, imprisonment, lack of funding, and coordinated online attacks and harassment. A free press is essential to a functioning democracy. Without press freedom, all human rights are at risk.

### Authoritarianism
According to Freedom House, global democracy is eroding. That includes countries with long-established democracies. In their 2022 report, the organization reveals that global freedom has been declining for the past 16 years. 60 countries faced declines in the last year. Only 25 saw improvements. Only 20% of the global population lives in Free countries. China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries have gained more power in the international system, while countries with established democracies – like the United States – are losing their freedoms. What can be done? Freedom House says success “requires a bold, sustained response that establishes support for democracy and countering authoritarianism.” Governments and citizens engage and stand for democracy.

## Local issues

### Racism
1. Ethnic Integration Policy
a. Higher House prices for various groups. Can affect any group. Some say reduces ethnic enclave formation.

2. Casual Racism
a. Increase in racist incidents
b. On the 5th of June 2022, A Ngee Ann Polytechnic Lecturer made racist remarks about a mixed-race couple in public. This lecturer promptly became a former lecturer and was charged with harming race relations under Section 298 of the penal code.

3. Racialization of identity
a. Our race is considered a strong part of our identity. Our race is on our identification card, passport and important documents. Opens the door to racial profiling and easier discrimination based on race since employers, real estate agents and others can look at this data. Social organisations are split based on race (Sinda, Mendaki, CDAC)

4. SAP schools
a. Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools which are specialised schools that only take in students who take Chinese. This is effectively segregation. Many of these SAP schools are considered elite schools and hence it also gatekeeps higher quality education for minorities.

### LGBTQ rights
1. Article 377A
a. s377A was introduced under colonial rule and criminalizes sex between males. while rarely enforced it has been the subject of criticism by many members and advocates of the LGBTQ community. Over the past few years, there have been numerous debates on whether it should be repealed as societal views shift to be more accepting of LGBTQ folk. The main opposition to the repeal has been religious groups which view homosexuality as a sin. However, this is not only a concern of religious people. Many non-religious people are fearful of homosexuality and view it as a threat to the family and current social norms. To appeal to both sides, the government agreed to repeal s377A, but it is strengthening the legal protection for the definition of traditional marriage making it harder for gay marriage to be legalized. I believe that the repeal of s377A is a step in the right direction when it comes to creating a more equitable society for LGBTQ folk.
