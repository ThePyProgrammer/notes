# Woke Culture

## Defintion

Woke is a slang term, which didn’t start out as one. It took birth in a dialect called African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In AAVE, awake is often rendered as woke.

The term of staying woke became a watchword in parts of the black community for those who were self-aware and for those who questioned the dominant paradigm and strived for something better. "Woke" can also refer, mockingly, to a white person whose perspectives on race equity change suddenly after learning about historical injustice.

Definition in oxford dictionary says ‘Alert to injustice in society, especially racism.’

|Some good/bad examples| Before boarding a flight to South Africa, Justine Sacco posted the following text on the social media platform Twitter "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!" This was a joke but the delivery was poor and the content was problematic. Sacco didn't have some sort of vendetta against African people she was South African herself and was just trying to highlight the ongoing racism when it comes to the AIDS crisis as compared to mocking it. Sacco was not given the chance to clear her stance or delete the tweet as she was on a plane. Before, the plane landed she was fired from her job and was blocked from various chat groups and circles. All her personal information was leaked and online users were tracking her flight in real-time anxiously waiting for her realisation that her world has crumbled. | Used to disenfranchize hate groups and hateful people, and deplatform sexual assaulters and Hollywood celebrities. i.e. the cancelling of Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. |

However, many of these powerful people still have a lot of power even after being deplatformed such as money and connections.  |
