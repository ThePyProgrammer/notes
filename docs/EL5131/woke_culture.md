# Woke Culture

## Facts (good or bad)

### Raising awareness of problems (good or bad)
1. Black Lives Matter movement - brought attention to injustices faced by black people in America such as violence from police officers and institutional racism experienced by black people such as the effects of redlining and racial segregation.
2. MeToo movement - brought attention to sexual harassment in Hollywood.

### Cancel culture (good or bad)
1.  Cancelling in a social media context refers to a form of ostracism in which someone is thrust out of professional or social circles after doing or saying something morally reprehensible or bigoted.
2. Negative -> Before boarding a flight to South Africa, Justine Sacco posted the following text on the social media platform Twitter "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!" This was a joke but the delivery was poor and the content was problematic. Sacco didn't have some sort of vendetta against African people she was South African herself and was just trying to highlight the ongoing racism when it comes to the AIDS crisis as compared to mocking it. Sacco was not given the chance to clear her stance or delete the tweet as she was on a plane. Before, the plane landed she was fired from her job and was blocked from various chat groups and circles. All her personal information was leaked and online users were tracking her flight in real-time anxiously waiting for her realisation that her world has crumbled.
3. Positive -> Used to disenfranchize hate groups and hateful people. Used to deplatform sexual assaulters and Hollywood celebrities. I.e. Cancelling of Harvey Weinstein.
4. Positive -> (Efficacy) It can be positive in that it can help to take down powerful people. However, many of these powerful people still have a lot of power even after being deplatformed such as money and connections.
5. Negative -> (Efficacy) It can be negative in that individuals who may have made a slight mistake may be ostracised from society. However, it sends a clear message to society, that such discourse is not tolerated.
