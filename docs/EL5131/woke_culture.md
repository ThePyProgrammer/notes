# Woke Culture

## Defintion

Woke is a slang term, which didn’t start out as one. It took birth in a dialect called African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In AAVE, awake is often rendered as woke.

The term of staying woke became a watchword in parts of the black community for those who were self-aware and for those who questioned the dominant paradigm and strived for something better. "Woke" can also refer, mockingly, to a white person whose perspectives on race equity change suddenly after learning about historical injustice.

Definition in Oxford Dictionary says ‘Alert to injustice in society, especially racism.’

### Cancel Culture
Cancelling in a social media context refers to a form of ostracism in which someone is thrust out of professional or social circles after doing or saying something morally reprehensible or bigoted. Woke culture is always associated with Cancel Culture, although they're NOT the same thing.


## Examples of Woke Culture

### Positive Examples
Many of these are associated with the idea of raising awareness of key problems and injustices

#### **Black Lives Matter** (BLM) movement
Brought attention to injustices faced by black people in America such as violence from police officers and institutional racism experienced by black people such as the effects of redlining and racial segregation.

Two key turning points that instigated increaed riots against racial injustices"
1. Michael Brown's death in 2011
2. George Floyd's death in 2020

#### **#MeToo** movement
Started in 2017, brought attention to sexual harassment in many workplaces, and especially in Hollywood, where such was prevalent at the time. It successfully deplatformed sexual assaulters and Hollywood celebrities, e.g. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey etc.


### Negative Examples
#### Justine Sacco
Before boarding a flight to South Africa, Justine Sacco posted the following text on the social media platform Twitter "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!" This was a joke but the delivery was poor and the content was problematic. Sacco didn't have some sort of vendetta against African people she was South African herself and was just trying to highlight the ongoing racism when it comes to the AIDS crisis as compared to mocking it. Sacco was not given the chance to clear her stance or delete the tweet as she was on a plane. Before, the plane landed she was fired from her job and was blocked from various chat groups and circles. All her personal information was leaked and online users were tracking her flight in real-time anxiously waiting for her realisation that her world has crumbled.

#### James Gunn
James Gunn, best known for directing the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films, was fired in 2019 due to his deleted 2011 tweets, which he had been largely apologetic about, being leaked by an indivudal. This led to major overhauls in Marvel Studio's initial movie plans and also led to James Gunn being ostracized by some of the biggest studios in world --> of course, he got his job back and he even went to other studios and made some of their greatest content over the past 2 years, but his life was in shambles after his firing.

**Problem Exposed**: Hypersensitive woke activists often search through the old posts of hundreds of individuals instead of simply doing something useful with their lives.

|Some good/bad examples|  Cancel Culture is very excessively used in multiple facets of work culture, which can have negative impacts on one's lives. | Used to disenfranchize hate groups and hateful people, and deplatform those who unjustly use their power to participate in malicious events |
|Problems with efficacy|  Individuals who make slight mistakes can be ostracised from society and fired from their jobs   |  It can help to take down powerful people. However, many of these powerful people still have a lot of power even after being deplatformed such as money and connections.  |
