# Relativity

## Energy of a Free Particle

$$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$

## Relativistic Effects


In your reference frame (i.e. the reference frame where you are at rest), your clock ticks at your **proper time** and your length is your **proper length**.

### Time Dilation
$$t' = \frac{t}{\gamma} = t\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$$

Where $t$ is your proper time, and $t'$ is the time in your specific reference frame.


### Length Contraction



## Questions
### USAPhO 2012 Question A1
A newly discovered subatomic particle, the _S meson_, has a mass $M$. When at rest, it lives for exactly $\tau = 3 \times 10^{âˆ’8}$ seconds before decaying into two identical particles called _P mesons_ (peons?) that each have a mass of $\alpha M$.

1. In a reference frame where the _S meson_ is at rest, determine the kinetic energy, $E_K$, the momentum, $p$, and the velocity, $v$, of each _P meson_ particle in terms of $M$, $\alpha$, the speed of light $c$, and any numerical constants.
2. In a reference frame where the _S meson_ travels 9 meters between creation and decay, determine the velocity, $v$, and kinetic energy, $E_K$ of the _S meson_. Write the answers in terms of $M$, the speed of light $c$, and any numerical constants.

#### Part 1
$$
\begin{align*}
Q &= -\Delta mc^{2}\\
&= (M - 2\alpha M)c^2 \\
E_K &= (\frac{1}2-\alpha)Mc^2 \\
p &= \sqrt{2mE_K} \\
&= Mc \sqrt{\alpha (1-2\alpha)} \\
v &= c\sqrt{\frac{1}\alpha - 2}
\end{align*}
