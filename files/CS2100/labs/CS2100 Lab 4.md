.data  
str: .asciiz "the answer = "  
.text  
  
main:  
	li $v0, 5 # reads in integer value to $v0  
	syscall # read in integer now  
  
	add $t0, $v0, $zero # copies value read into $t0  
  
	li $v0, 4 # system call code for print_string  
	la $a0, str # address of string to print  
	syscall # print the string  
  
	li $v0, 1 # system call code for print_int  
	add $a0, $t0, $zero # integer to print  
	syscall # print the integer  
	  
	li $v0, 10 # system call code for exit  
	syscall # terminate program
```

## Task 2
- Where is the array **`arrayA`** located in the data segment? Give the base address (starting address) of the array: **`0x10010000`**
- Where is the program variable count in the data segment?: **`0x10010014`**
- When enlarging the array to size 8. FIll in the assembler directive as follows: **`arrayA: .word 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 6, 7, 8`**
