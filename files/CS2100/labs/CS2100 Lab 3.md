```ad-question
title: Open **`sample1.asm`** into QTSpim and click the "Single Step" button. What number base is the value in register `$t1`?

**Answer**: Hexadecimal
```

```ad-question
title: Figure out how the string `"Hello"` has been stored in `sample2.asm`

|Property|`'H'`|`'e'`|`'l'`|`'o'`|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ASCII Value|72|101|108|111|
|Hexadecimal|`0x48`|`0x65`|`0x6c`|`0x6f`|

Since the code is `6c6c6548 0000006f`, it stores the values in descending order in blocks of 1 byte each.
