Question:
> A parallel-plate capacitor is shown in the diagram with plate area of $A = 10.5\text{ cm}^2$ and plate separation $2d = 7.12\text{ mm}$. The left half of the gap is filled with material of dielectric constant $\kappa_1 = 21.0$; the top of the right half is filled with material of dielectric constant $\kappa_2 = 42.0$; the bottom of the right half is filled with material of dielectric constant $\kappa_3 = 58.0$. What is the capacitance?

Answer:
Well, firstly you can treat each of these as individual capacitors, notably all having the same surface area of $A/2$. However, this question isn't **that** easy.

First, let's denote each "sub-capacitor" as $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$ based off their dielectric constants.

Thus, we have the following expression to denote the capacitance $C$ of the overall capacitor:
$$
\begin{align*}
C &= C_1 + \left(\frac{1}{C_2}+\frac{1}{C_2}\right)^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$

From here, to make our life easier, we can get a series of expressions for $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$, as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
C_1 &= \frac{\kappa_1 \epsilon_o A/2}{2d} = \frac{\kappa_1}{4}\frac{\epsilon_o A}{d} \\
C_2 &= \frac{\kappa_2 \epsilon_o A/2}{d} = \frac{\kappa_2}{2}\frac{\epsilon_o A}{d} \\
C_3 &= \frac{\kappa_3 \epsilon_o A/2}{d} = \frac{\kappa_3}{2}\frac{\epsilon_o A}{d}
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, we have the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
C &= \frac{\kappa_1}{4}\frac{\epsilon_o A}{d} + \left(\frac{2}{\kappa_2} \frac{d}{\epsilon_o A} + \frac{2}{\kappa_3} \frac{d}{\epsilon_o A} \right)^{-1} \\
&= \left(\frac{\kappa_1}{4} + \frac{\kappa_2 \kappa_3}{2(\kappa_2 + \kappa_3)} \right) \frac{\epsilon_o A}{d}
\end{align*}
$$

From here, we simply substitute the values to get our final value.
