### How tech progresss aids
- Largely technologically reliant nations are usually have large economic reserves
- Large economic reserves = capital accululation
- Sri Lanka's wealth was mismanaged, it was not able to reach the heights of other developed nations
- Developing economies in general, while maybe technologically abreast as other countries, lack capital reserves
- Can't export much, despite having potential, they're unable to bring forth captial accumulation
